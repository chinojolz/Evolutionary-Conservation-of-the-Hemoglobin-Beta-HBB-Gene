# Evolutionary-Conservation-of-the-Hemoglobin-Beta-HBB-Gene
## Project Overview

This project investigates the evolutionary conservation of the Hemoglobin Beta (HBB) gene across different species, specifically *Homo sapiens* (humans), *Mus musculus* (mice), and *Danio rerio* (zebra fish). The HBB gene encodes a vital component of hemoglobin, which is essential for oxygen transport in the bloodstream.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

1. Perform sequence retrieval using BLAST
2. Conduct pairwise and multiple sequence alignments
3. Generate sequence logos to visualize conservation
4. Construct phylogenetic trees to infer evolutionary relationships
5. Practice documenting and presenting scientific findings

## Methods

The following bioinformatics tools and resources were utilized:

- **NCBI:** For sequence retrieval.
- **EMBOSS Needle:** For pairwise sequence alignment.
- **ClustalW:** For multiple sequence alignment.
- **Skylign:** For generating sequence logos.
- **MEGA X:** For constructing phylogenetic trees.

## Results

### 1. Pairwise Sequence Alignment

**Explanation:** The pairwise sequence alignment was performed using EMBOSS Needle. The output shows matched nucleotides represented by vertical lines, indicating conserved regions between the sequences of interest. It also shows the gap penalties, which are scores assigned when inserting gaps; the similarity score, which indicates how well the sequences align overall; and the match/mismatch, which identifies identical or different nucleotides at each position in the alignment. This alignment helps identify essential functional areas of the HBB gene.

### 2. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)

**Explanation:** The MSA was conducted using ClustalW. The alignment output highlights conserved regions across multiple sequences, with asterisks indicating highly conserved residues. This analysis underscores the evolutionary significance of these regions.

### 3. Sequence Logo Generation

**Explanation:** The sequence logo generated using Skylign visually represents nucleotide conservation across the aligned sequences. Taller stacks indicate higher conservation at specific positions, reflecting evolutionary pressure on these sites.

### 4. Phylogenetic Tree Construction

**Explanation:** The phylogenetic tree constructed using MEGA X illustrates the evolutionary relationships among the species studied. The branch lengths indicate genetic divergence, with closer relationships observed between *Homo sapiens* and *Mus musculus* compared to *Danio rerio*.
